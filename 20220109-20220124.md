The whole system is open source, and (if you're brave!) you can run it yourself: https://github.com/penrose/penrose

#### DL architectures

[Taco Cohen](https://twitter.com/TacoCohen/status/1480855159236440066)

The first law of DL architectures:   "Whatever" is all you need. Any problem that can be solved by transformer / ViT can be solved by MLP / CNN, and vice versa (provided you do exhaustive tuning, and use the right inductive bias).  

Like [A ConvNet for the 2020s](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.03545)

Same for RNNs: [Capacity and Trainability in Recurrent Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09913)

#### paper writing

[Thomas G. Dietterich](https://twitter.com/tdietterich/status/1481023353322307585)
The term "ablation" is widely misused lately in ML papers. An ablation is a removal: you REMOVE some component of the system (e.g., remove batchnorm). A "sensitivity analysis" is where you VARY some component (e.g., network width).

Unsolicited paper writing tip: 

Don’t claim “We are the FIRST to do…”

Found many papers falsely claimed it as a contribution. (You never knew what some researchers have done in the 90s!)

#### debate between ConvNets and Transformers

[Yann LeCun](https://twitter.com/ylecun/status/1481196571534536704)

ConvNeXt: the debate heats up between ConvNets and Transformers for vision!

Very nice work from FAIR+BAIR colleagues showing that with the right combination of methods, ConvNets are better than Transformers for vision. 87.1% top-1 ImageNet-1k.[ConvNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.03545)

Some of the helpful tricks make complete sense: larger kernels, layer norm, fat layer inside residual blocks, one stage of non-linearity per residual block, separate downsampling layers....

Am I going to argue that "Conv is all you need"?
No!
My favorite architecture is DETR-like: ConvNet (or ConvNeXt) for the first layers, then something more memory-based and permutation invariant like transformer blocks for object-based reasoning on top.

#### [ VERIV - Vscode Extended Range Imaging Viewer](https://twitter.com/mcrespo__/status/1483085482179366923)

How does it work? You only need to install it and open a compatible LDR or HDR file. 
The viewer will open automatically, allowing you to view the image, move it, zoom in and out, and adjust the exposure.
